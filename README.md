# Lingering Click Tooltips

Generates tooltips (or toasts) for left click actions, just like tapping the screen on the mobile client. But more powerful.

Choose whether to filter certain trivial actions such as walking or eating.
Select between different, convenient operating modes to provide more uses.

Offers lots of options to configure tooltip appearance, including duration, fade, cursor anchoring, color, and position.
There are many ways to combine the different settings. Hopefully everyone can make use of this feature!
